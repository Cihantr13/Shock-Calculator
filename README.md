# Shock-Calculator


# Overview
The Shock Calculator is a tool designed to calculate various aerodynamic properties across ramps and shock waves in supersonic flow conditions. This tool provides detailed outputs of 
temperature, pressure, density, Mach number, and velocity variations along with the Total Pressure Recovery (TPR) across the ramps.

Features
- Calculate total temperature and pressure variations across the ramps.
- Determine static temperature and pressure variations across the ramps.
- Assess density variations across the geometry of ramps.
- Analyze Mach number and velocity variations across the ramps.
- Compute TPR (Total Pressure Recovery) variations across the ramps.
Inputs
- Freestream Mach Number (M)
- Altitude (h)
- Number of Ramps (up to 4)
- Ramp Angle or Shock Angle
- Presence of a Normal Shock Wave
Outputs
- Total temperature and pressure variation across the ramps
- Static temperature and pressure variation across the ramps
- Density variation across the geometry of ramps
- Mach Number and Velocity variation across the ramps
- TPR (Total Pressure Recovery) variation across the ramps
Usage
Step 1: Initialize Parameters
The user is prompted to input the following parameters:

Freestream conditions (Altitude, Mach Number)
Number of ramps
Ramp angles or shock angles
Presence of a normal shock wave
Step 2: Calculation and Plotting
The code calculates the necessary aerodynamic properties and plots the results.
